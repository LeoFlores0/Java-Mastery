# Java Portfolio Projects

**Java learning projects and challenges demonstrating core OOP concepts, data structures, and problem-solving skills for software engineering co-op readiness.**

This repository contains all my projects completed as part of my Java Mastery Plan. These projects showcase my understanding of Java from basic syntax to intermediate object-oriented programming.

## Projects Overview

### Week 1: Basics
- **High Score Tracker** – Practice with variables, input/output, and basic logic.
- **Palindrome Checker** – String manipulation and conditional logic.

### Week 2: Methods
- **Multiply Numbers** – Methods, return values, and basic arithmetic.
- **Add Numbers** – Further practice with methods and parameter handling.

### Week 3: Classes & OOP
- **Constructors and Getters/Setters** – Encapsulation and object initialization.
- **Method Overloading and Overriding** – Polymorphism practice.
- **Access Modifiers** – Public, private, protected, and package-level access.

### Week 4: Advanced OOP
- **Static and Final Keywords** – Class-level fields and constants.
- **Abstract Classes** – Implementing abstract methods and inheritance.
- **BankAccount Simulation** – Bank accounts with deposits, withdrawals, transaction history, overdraft limits, and monthly interest. Demonstrates static fields, ArrayLists, and OOP design.

## Summary

These projects demonstrate progressive mastery of Java from basic syntax to intermediate object-oriented programming, providing a strong foundation for co-op readiness.
